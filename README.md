# Hustlin Billiards Website

## Description

Hustlin Billiards is a static website for a billiards bar located at 12010 Quentin Road, Palatine, IL 60067. I've created this project while I took a class at a local community college. The website showcases the bar's offerings including appetizers, beers and cocktails, events, pool tables, and provides information about the location and contact details.
